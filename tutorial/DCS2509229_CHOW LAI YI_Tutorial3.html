<h2 align=left><font face=Times New Roman size=4 color=red><b>Short Story</b>: <font size=5 color=orange>The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf</h2>

<hr size=4 color=green>

<p align=justify><font size=4 color=black>A <i><b><big>shepherd</i></b></big> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <font size=5><i><b>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</i></b></p>

<br>

<p align=justify><font size=4>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike></p>

<br>

<p align=justify><font size=5 color=purple>The farmer <font size=4><sup>thought</sup> <font size=5>the boy was playing <font size=3><small>mischief</small> <font size=5>again. <font size=4 color=black>So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to help.</p>
